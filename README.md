### Features

- Jailbreak
- Sandbox escape
- Enable Remote Play

### Notes
**Only for 5.05 Jailbroken PlayStation 4 consoles!**

When you load payload, it will simulate the IDU mode with patches, this will allow you to enable to register any device for remote play from the options menu.

During IDU mode there are some limitations in the UI such as the disabled PS button event.

It is recommended to reboot after finishing the registration of the devices.

**I do not take any responsibility in case of damage. Use at your risk.**
